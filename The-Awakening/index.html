<p>Facebook seems a part of my life now. I logged on and saw that a lot of friends had changed their profile pictures to something patriotic. Scrolled down to see friends traveling and posting pictures. And then i came across a video post from a friend. And i got real emotional. </p>
<img src="/images/MockeryOfIndians.PNG">

<p>And this is how i responded to the post.</p>
<img src="/images/SameeriResponse.PNG">

<p>You can watch the video the video, that triggered my emotions…over <a href="(http://www.storypick.com/independence-day-questions/">here</a>.</p>
<p>For the next day or two, i couldn’t get my thoughts off this post. And it kept rolling. I just decided to type out what i felt. And these were the words in my mind.</p>
<p>“India is my home country! I was born here. I was raised up here. I had 25 amazing years spent here. </p>
<p>I grew up with values driven into me. Heard stories of bravery, valor, truth, love, loyalty, faithfulness, courage, wits and so much more.</p>
<p>I am proud that i was born here.. grew up in a country that is so diverse in nature.. that has peace and harmony in it’s soil and air..</p>
<p>When i was a kid, i used to be soo excited to get ready to do a parade on the independence day and do a salute to the national flag, leading my group.</p>
<p>Nothing more was awesomer.</p>
<p>Nothing was more amazing then singing the national anthem every day, just before we left for home from school!</p>
<p>Then there was the national pledge that i used to take at school.. every single day. Along side all my friends.</p>
<p>Do i remember my own words. Was the pledge a fallacy? Am i living up to it?</p>
<p>It has been a journey..</p>
<p>Growing up, a person learns..</p>
<p>He learns so many things from friends, relationships.. environment..</p>
<p>Each person has unique experiences and learn thier own way..</p>
<p>Along the way, however, priorities take order..</p>
<p>People think they should make more money, take care of their family.. earn fame.. and so on..This is great.</p>
<p>Some peeople have noble thoughts of serving the community.</p>
<p>Can someone show me a nation so awesome as India.. so many languages. so many cultures.. so much art.. so much diversity..</p>
<p>The values and other things that i have learnt from my family are amazing.. but i credit India with those.. </p>
<p>India has given those thoughts and values to my family and they just passed it on to me..</p>
<p>Indians are such amazing people.. They only know one thing.. and they do it well.. love..</p>
<p>Whatever they do, they put in their hearts, their hearts are always on fire.. whatever small things they do.</p>
<p>I have never ever seen more passionate people.</p>
<p>Their relationships, work, food they cook.. whatever they do .. they do it with Love</p>
<p>They support India by foregoing nights of sleep and watching cricket matches.. update their fb profiles.. and posts with national pride..</p>
<p>That’s great!</p>
<p>People of India need to waken up however..</p>
<p>Every time some people speak.. they propogate negative energy..</p>
<p>They complain.. they blame..</p>
<p>India is not about politics or politicians..</p>
<p>India is about it’s people.. and about.. well.. India.. </p>
<p>What about India, every nation is about it’s people. </p>
<p>It’s a grand land that civilization was first found here..</p>
<p>Sometimes.. we see videos that make a mockery of India..</p>
<p><a href="http://www.storypick.com/independence-day-questions/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.storypick.com/independence-day-questions/</a></p>
<p>We  see such stuff. And we laugh about the stupidity of the people.</p>
<p>I however am ashamed of it..</p>
<p>And it’s like making a mockery of India on the Independence day!</p>
<p>And that’s the reason i thought to myself.. </p>
<p>Is this real?</p>
<p>Why we are like this?</p>
<p>Why some people even don’t know the basic stuff about India?</p>
<p>Is it the education system?</p>
<p>What should we do?</p>
<p>What do we know about India? What do I know about India?</p>
<p>How to teach people and learn from people?</p>
<p>How about other things like:</p>
<p>What are our constitutional rights?</p>
<p>How much do we owe to the world bank?</p>
<p>Where is our money minted?</p>
<p>What happens to our taxes?</p>
<p>What is corruption? Why should we give money to people who are doing a job so that they can serve us..</p>
<p>What would we say if someone asks something about our country?</p>
<p>What if they ask about poverty?</p>
<p>What if they ask us about the negative things like dowry, harrassment in the name of dowry, child marriages?</p>
<p>How do we respond to these questions?</p>
<p>We should learn, educate and increase knowledge.. about India..</p>
<p>We should spread this learning.. It should be a wildfire..</p>
<p>Whereever we are.. we should have things to know about India.. and speak about India..</p>
<p>We should know about the great things of India.. and speak about them.</p>
<p>We have to be fearless.. we should know our homeland..our motherland and speak well about it.</p>
<p>What of the various people.. we ourselves should make India strong..</p>
<p>This can only come from education..and sharing.</p>
<p>People will only know what they have seen, been told or what they read.</p>
<p>If we speak, show, write good; then, they see good things about our country. </p>
<p>So sometimes we see videos like this and it fills my heart with happiness.. where people are trying to communicate positive stuff..</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkbQcayOsc0" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkbQcayOsc0</a></p>
<p>It’s not a one man’s country.. it never was, it never is.</p>
<p>It’s my country.. it’s your country.. it’s our country..</p>
<p>We might not be soldiers at the boder.. but we all can fight.. we all can do something.. atleast keep a street clean.. together..</p>
<p>We have no time for anything in life.. </p>
<p>Atleast let’s take a minute that we usually spend to send a watsapp message to a friend to learn something about India..</p>
<p>And then let’s share this information.</p>
<p>I’m going to learn and share the same with my friends.. so can you!</p>
<p>Today’s world.. has technology so awesome, that information can reach people in an instant.</p>
<p>We should use this technology and the amazing people of India to generate waves of awesomenes..</p>
<p>We should create waves of positive energy.</p>
<p>For me, India is my motherland.. My home, My country, My love.</p>
<p>I will not sit and wait for someone else to do stuff. I shall do my own stuff, however small it might be!</p>
<p>For me, It’s time to get up and do. Slumber time is up! </p>
<p>This is not my project.. This is India’s project..</p>
<p>India calls me to wake up.. India calls you to Wake up!</p>
<p>Jai Hind!”</p>
<p>So that’s the beginning, the story of <strong>IndiaAwake</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are reading up this page, that’s because we have started. We have taken one tiny step. It’s a great challenge infront of us, you and me, as to explore how to use technology to share information,as to what we can do. And a bigger challenge is to create waves of postivity. </p>
<p>I’m going to keep writing these thoughts as they come. Hopefully, we all shall soon see the amazing energy that you have in you to help all of us out.</p>
