> "Each holiday, reunion celebrated with our friends, our family is an amazing
   experience. We love to plan, find a vacation rental, a huge house, get together, 
   and have a blast under one roof. Not hotel rooms, but one house to stay in.
   Away from home, we have the warmth and love of friends. We celebrate the joy of
   being together. Every memory brings back great spirit and joy, and the heart longs
   to do this over and over again. This space, where our apps would be showcased, has been named 
   in honor of such lovely memories spent in large vacation rentals and to great friends."

   is a `Space`. Ready to be discovered and explored. It's an adventourous realm. We do 
   not want to limit ourselves to one technology. We want to use the richness of various technology
   options, to see what we can build. We would love to explore, use, build and share what we have learnt."

> "India Awake is a baby. It's a kiddo. Every baby step, every crawling move, every trick learnt,
   it's so joyous. What we can learn from today's parents, is they use technology to record and share. 
   The first steps taken by their baby, thier expressions. They click away pictures of delightful moments. 
   Cute little things, they fall, they rise, they play, they are so fun to watch. We go back to the olden golden days, with a little diary of our love, to write down the
   thoughts."

> "You sit at a restaurant, a coffee shop. And you want to discuss something,
   write down your thoughts, share your stuff, all you have to draw on is a paper napkin. It's easy to
   express something on a paper quick, to draw something on a white board. Ideas are communicated so. Everytime,
   someone tells us something, we would like to scribble it down, so we won't forget.
