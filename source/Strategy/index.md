> **India Awake** is about openness, about learning and about sharing. Our aim is simple. We love India. We love to use technology. We would like to use technology as a medium to learn and share more about India. We strongly believe in positive energy, and are certain that everyone has greatness in them. We would love to see the positive energy of everyone pouring in and creating waves of awesomeness. You could teach us a thing or two about our Motherland, and then suddenly, you are an **India Awake Hero**, you are our hero. We will be so happy and so very thankful for your contribution.

Currently the site you are seeing is running on the [Github](https://github.com/) platform, using Github pages. We have chosen, the newest blog engine available, [Hexo](http://hexo.io/), to write out our thoughts. 

We are very social and so we have an account on Facebook. A page that would share and promote greatness of India, has been setup and hopefully you will go like it, to receive updates on your wall.

Technology centric, we would like to create apps. Apps that would teach us more about India in creative ways. Apps that might help out other Indian buddies. People could get other creative ideas and help us build useful apps. Every App that would be developed would be open sourced and available on Github, at [https://github.com/IndiaAwake](https://github.com/IndiaAwake). As i say these words, our friends are brainstorming and exploring technologies. The apps would find be given love and care, at [www.indiaawake.org/Apps](www.indiaawake.org/Apps). `TechnoSpace` would be where we would like to share our research, findings, implementations as a wiki. 

A lot of energy has been shown by our friends and families to help support this idea. A great challenge is how to address and implement ideas that are generated, and issues that prop up. Currently, out of any other better alternative, we are using a repository and creating issues for ideas, [here](https://github.com/indiaawake/IndiaAwake-BucketList/issues). As projects get created, any issues or ideas will be addressed in their respective repository. Hopefully, we shall take baby steps and have some fun as we go along.. We would like scribble down such thoughts and ideas in our `ScribblePad`.

We love best wishes! We love encouragement. If you think, you could contribute or want to know more, as to how to.. please send a mail to us at **mail.indiaawake@gmail.com**. People associate the word `contributions` to money, usually. We seek knowledge. If you are an Engineer, you could help us implementing an idea. If you are a writer, you could help us with writing. If you like making movies, help us in making an inspirational video. Photography being your strength, click away pictures that will inspire us to work harder. If you love singing, write a song, sing for India, we will hum along. If your strenth lies in using social media, and you are a social media champ, help us spread the word. Whatever you do, we will love you for it. 

We would honestly and most sincerely love to hear your thoughts, your ideas, and suggestions and will try to learn from your Wisdom.
