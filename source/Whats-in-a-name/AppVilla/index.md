*"Each holiday, reunion celebrated with our friends, our family is an amazing
   experience. We love to plan, find a vacation rental, a huge house, get together, 
   and have a blast under one roof. Not hotel rooms, but one house to stay in.
   Away from home, we have the warmth and love of friends. We celebrate the joy of
   being together. Every memory brings back great spirit and joy, and the heart longs
   to do this over and over again. This space, where our apps would be showcased, has been named 
   in honor of such lovely memories spent in large vacation rentals and to great friends."*
