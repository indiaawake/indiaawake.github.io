*"You sit at a restaurant, a coffee shop. And you want to discuss something,
   write down your thoughts, share your stuff, all you have to draw on is a paper napkin. It's easy to
   express something on a paper quick, to draw something on a white board. Ideas are communicated so. Everytime,
   someone tells us something, we would like to scribble it down, so we won't forget. For we love ideas and positive
   thoughts and we do not want to even lose one of them"*
