*"India Awake is a baby. It's a kiddo. Every baby step, every crawling move, every trick learnt,
   it's so joyous. What we can learn from today's parents, is they use technology to record and share. 
   The first steps taken by their baby, thier expressions. They click away pictures of delightful moments. 
   Cute little things, they fall, they rise, they play, they are so fun to watch. We go back to the olden golden days, with a little diary of our love, to write down the
   thoughts."*
