Dear Diary,

This is our first ever note to you..We are so happy! It has been a great week.
We have begun. We have made a start. Most of it has been thinking, organizing, and setting up. 

Baby steps we have taken this week.
1. A facebook account and a facebook page. [https://www.facebook.com/pages/India-Awake/1504607306444872](https://www.facebook.com/pages/India-Awake/1504607306444872)
2. A domain name has been registered with GoDaddy. `www.indiaawake.org`
4. Github has been setup. [www.github.com/indiaawake](www.github.com/indiaawake)
5. Using Githubpages, and Hexo blogging platform, we have jump started.
6. We have a few pages setup and we have given names to spaces.
7. We have couple of images to help us build an identity.

Total Radness!

A couple of issues and check list items remain. But that's something we will tell you next week.

Love,

IndiaAwake
