Dear Diary,

How have you been? We have had some more important setup stuff to do this week.

- More brainstorming and discussions.
- Found a great way to track our ideas, progress. Setup [Trello](https://trello.com/).
- Created a google form to see how people think and if they want to contribute, where their interests lie.
- Setup our YouTube channel. 
- Setup and added Google Analytics to our blog.

Hopefully, we can start involving friends soon and see how it goes. :)

Love,
India Awake
