#####Independence day, 2014

Facebook seems a part of my life now. I logged on and saw that a lot of friends had changed their profile pictures to something patriotic. Scrolled down to see friends traveling and posting pictures. And then i came across a video post from a friend. And i got real emotional.

You can watch the video the video, that triggered my emotions...over [here]((http://www.storypick.com/independence-day-questions/).


For the next day or two, i couldn't get my thoughts off this post. And it kept rolling. I just decided to type out what i felt. And these were the words in my mind.


"India is my home country! I was born here. I was raised up here. I had 25 amazing years spent here. 

I grew up with values driven into me. Heard stories of bravery, valor, truth, love, loyalty, faithfulness, courage, wits and so much more.

I am proud that i was born here.. grew up in a country that is so diverse in nature.. that has peace and harmony in it's soil and air..

When i was a kid, i used to be soo excited to get ready to do a parade on the independence day and do a salute to the national flag, leading my group.

Nothing more was awesomer.

Nothing was more amazing then singing the national anthem every day, just before we left for home from school!

Then there was the national pledge that i used to take at school.. every single day. Along side all my friends.

Do i remember my own words. Was the pledge a fallacy? Am i living up to it?

It has been a journey..

Growing up, a person learns..

He learns so many things from friends, relationships.. environment..

Each person has unique experiences and learn thier own way..

Along the way, however, priorities take order..

People think they should make more money, take care of their family.. earn fame.. and so on..This is great.

Some peeople have noble thoughts of serving the community.

Can someone show me a nation so awesome as India.. so many languages. so many cultures.. so much art.. so much diversity..

The values and other things that i have learnt from my family are amazing.. but i credit India with those.. 

India has given those thoughts and values to my family and they just passed it on to me..

Indians are such amazing people.. They only know one thing.. and they do it well.. love..

Whatever they do, they put in their hearts, their hearts are always on fire.. whatever small things they do.

I have never ever seen more passionate people.

Their relationships, work, food they cook.. whatever they do .. they do it with Love

They support India by foregoing nights of sleep and watching cricket matches.. update their fb profiles.. and posts with national pride..

That's great!

People of India need to waken up however..

Every time some people speak.. they propogate negative energy..

They complain.. they blame..

India is not about politics or politicians..

India is about it's people.. and about.. well.. India.. 

What about India, every nation is about it's people. 

It's a grand land that civilization was first found here..

Sometimes.. we see videos that make a mockery of India..

[http://www.storypick.com/independence-day-questions/](http://www.storypick.com/independence-day-questions/)

We  see such stuff. And we laugh about the stupidity of the people.

I however am ashamed of it..

And it's like making a mockery of India on the Independence day!

And that's the reason i thought to myself.. 

Is this real?

Why we are like this?

Why some people even don't know the basic stuff about India?

Is it the education system?

What should we do?

What do we know about India? What do I know about India?

How to teach people and learn from people?

How about other things like:

What are our constitutional rights?

How much do we owe to the world bank?

Where is our money minted?

What happens to our taxes?

What is corruption? Why should we give money to people who are doing a job so that they can serve us..

What would we say if someone asks something about our country?

What if they ask about poverty?

What if they ask us about the negative things like dowry, harrassment in the name of dowry, child marriages?

How do we respond to these questions?

We should learn, educate and increase knowledge.. about India..

We should spread this learning.. It should be a wildfire..

Whereever we are.. we should have things to know about India.. and speak about India..

We should know about the great things of India.. and speak about them.

We have to be fearless.. we should know our homeland..our motherland and speak well about it.

What of the various people.. we ourselves should make India strong..

This can only come from education..and sharing.

People will only know what they have seen, been told or what they read.

If we speak, show, write good; then, they see good things about our country. 

So sometimes we see videos like this and it fills my heart with happiness.. where people are trying to communicate positive stuff..

It's not a one man's country.. it never was, it never is.

It's my country.. it's your country.. it's our country..

We might not be soldiers at the boder.. but we all can fight.. we all can do something.. atleast keep a street clean.. together..

We have no time for anything in life.. 

Atleast let's take a minute that we usually spend to send a watsapp message to a friend to learn something about India..

And then let's share this information.

I'm going to learn and share the same with my friends.. so can you!

Today's world.. has technology so awesome, that information can reach people in an instant.

We should use this technology and the amazing people of India to generate waves of awesomenes..

We should create waves of positive energy.

For me, India is my motherland.. My home, My country, My love.

I will not sit and wait for someone else to do stuff. I shall do my own stuff, however small it might be!

For me, It's time to get up and do. Slumber time is up! 

This is not my project.. This is India's project..

India calls me to wake up.. India calls you to Wake up!

Jai Hind!"


So that's the beginning, the story of **IndiaAwake**.

If you are reading up this page, that's because we have started. We have taken one tiny step. It's a great challenge infront of us, you and me, as to explore how to use technology to share information,as to what we can do. And a bigger challenge is to create waves of postivity. 

I'm going to keep writing these thoughts as they come. Hopefully, we all shall soon see the amazing energy that you have in you to help all of us out.
